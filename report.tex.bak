\title{Efficient Ray Tracing Techniques}

\author{Dario Seyb}

\maketitle

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Abstract

\begin{abstract}%
Ray Tracing is next to rasterization the most widely used technique to generate discrete 2D images from continuous 3D scenes. Until recently ray tracing was too resource intensive to produce images in realtime, but advances in hardware capabilities, most notably the introduction of GPGPU (General Purpose Graphics Processing Units), and algorithms made near-realtime ray tracing feasible. In this paper we will present some of the techniques which are used to achieve this.
